TeamShuffle
===========

When you're a manager it's sometimes sensitive when you pick people on your team to do things. This script leaves everything to (pseudo)randomness.

## CLI Instructions

You can run this on the command line by creating a file called team.txt and running shuffle.rb like so: ./shuffle.rb

## Web Instructions

Alternatively, you can just have a website to go to when you need it. To do this, install the team.php file on a server running PHP and browse to the page.
